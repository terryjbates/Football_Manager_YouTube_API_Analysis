Part 1 of a brand new Football Manager 2021 challenge mini-series. Barcelona are £1billion in debt and I've created a database to reflect the debt, along with all the up to date real life transfers and a start date in the 2021/22 season - it's like playing Football Manager 2022 early (sort of!). We've got 4 seasons in this series to turn around Barca's financial problem, get them out of debt and build a squad capable of winning the Champions League again while we do it!

Check out the rest of the Rebuilding Barcelona playlist here 👉https://bit.ly/RebuildingBarca

5,Zealand,pmdIkhfmY6w,1545.0,"So, you want the best regen / newgen facepack ever made? Well, here you go! In an effort that took nearly a year, we managed to create a complete pack of ethnically sorted, AI-generated faces (which are unlimited in sample size and thus can be created to no end) that then assign to your regens or newgens while recognizing skin color and ethnicity. I can’t imagine someone has put more effort into a Football Manager facepack for newgens and regens than this. I’m happy to finally, actually tell you how to use it.

The first video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZRcjkRKbLE&t=268s) I didn’t do a great job of actually teaching you how to use it, and v1 was super buggy compared to now, so it was time to iron out the bugs and the installation process. Now FM has the perfect facepack on windows and mac, in a few easy steps. If only football manager had managed to keep my mac charger from dying while filming, then the NewGAN guide would be with you a few days earlier. I touched my mac for you, just to show how much I care.

Happy installing - if you have any questions, hit the comments! I promise we’ve really sorted every bug now thanks to ya’lls help it should be 100% smooth for every setup.

Email if something breaks just in case: SAGKRZealandReport@gmail

Much Love,
FM Senpai

It identifies ethnicity. It identifies skin color. It has a UI that helps you install it. It took six months and a team of brilliant people to make. This is my favorite thing around Football Manager I have ever done, a passion project, and I am so thankful for Samaroy, Gestalt, Krysler, HRiddick, and my mod team for actually knowing how to do it and providing the processing power. Football Manager has really never seen anything like this before, and we hope to keep improving this regen facepack in the future, making it better and better.

I am always trying to make better things for you guys, know that. I love Football Manager and now that I have a chance to really make impactful improvements to it that’s what I’ll be doing. If you have any ideas like this, of course, let me know, I love comments. Hopefully, people on Football Manager around the world can enjoy this regen face pack and create endless stories with its realism. I for sure will.


Much Love,
FM Senpai


Get the facepack here:

*individual downloads below if you prefer the painful method*


File Paths:
%localappdata%\Programs\NewGAN Manager 
%userprofile%\Documents\Sports Interactive\Football Manager 2021\views

Forgot to mention an important step (FIXES NEWGAN NOT OPENING):
In %localappdata%\Programs\NewGAN Manager open the ""app"" folder and copy the .config folder.
Then got back to the NewGAN Manager folder and paste the .config folder and overwrite.

If you have the in-game editor, in scouting click ""Add Condition"", select ""Hidden"" - ""Is newgen"" and then change ""is"" to ""is not""

IF SOMETHING MESSES UP, ENTER THE FOLLOWING FILE PATH:
%localappdata%\Programs\NewGAN Manager\newgan.log

Save the newgan.log and attach it and the .RTF file (from 14:34) to: SAGKRZealandReport@gmail.com

Over the last 5 years Tours FC have been relegated from the French second tier to the sixth tier due to financial mismanagement. This feels like a problem I can solve, as I'm well known for my excellent handling of finances in Football Manager... This FM22 Road to Glory save sees me aiming to take Tours from the French regional leagues to the top of Ligue 1, with the ultimate goal of toppling Paris Saint Germain as the dominant force in French football - all without messing up the finances again...

13,Zealand,VdNH-_z-whk,1003.0,"We just had what may be the best World Cup on the field that anyone has ever seen. So now, it is time to assemble the worse teams in the world to play their own World Cup. It is only fair. They might not have Messi but these teams do try to qualify every time and never seem to have a chance to make the World Cup. Fear no more!


We put together a qualifying system that only gets the worst of the worst with a good balance between all of the continents. It felt like the best way to do it, make sure it’s fair for everyone. Asia still got a crazy number of teams in though, which was fun for them, but not really for some of the other continents, because their World Cup teams got abused. It was a very fun journey, I hope you enjoy it!

Much Love,
FM Senpai

Hey - happy holidays, I hope you got Football Manager! Whether you did or you already had FM, FM Llama and I have sat down to put together a truly wonderful guide that should keep you entertained for ages. A list of one great save in every European league in Football Manager. We thought about doing the whole world, but that is just a bit excessive isn’t it, while one save for every FM European league is totally reasonable and definitely didn’t take any time at all.

FM Llama and I had a great time compiling this list - he is a genius - and I know this will be supplying saves for everyone long into the future. That makes me happy, because there is nothing more frustrating in Football Manager than knowing you want to play it but not having the faintest idea about how to get into a save, or what save you want to do. Now all you have to do is watch all the other tutorials about how to play FM in the first place and you will be all set!

Much Love,

The time has arrived: women’s leagues are coming to Football Manager. It has been announced, women will be right alongside the men in the next few years in our favorite FM universe. This is good because it mimics the real universe, where, you know, women play soccer the same way men do. The US Women’s National Team happens to be pretty good too (recent men’s Gold Cup victory acknowledged though). I am excited for this, probably the biggest FM development in the last few years, so let’s dive into it.

The questions you have are typically ‘how is this going to change the game’ or ‘how will it work’ and I have read the available material to be able to answer them. Football Manager itself will not change, but it is important to understand the amount of work this takes for FM to add women into the game. It is honestly insane how hard it is for them to do, so appreciate it and know that it will just make the gaming experience deeper. You’ll see, just watch the video it’s FOOTBALL MANAGER BREAKING NEWS.

Much Love,
FM Senpai

It is an app though so be warned. If you don’t want to give your number, just download it off an app store and find me. I’m featured so, see you there. It’s not a sponsor or anything, like they actually just gave us some perks as a community, which is cool.

I made my picks yesterday, now we see what our overlords at football manager have to say about what will happen in Euro 2020. The squads are accurate in this simulation, so are the groups (obviously, I mean come on). This is as accurate as you can possibly be on FM trying to show what it thinks will happen in the European Championship - and the results might surprise you!

I’m so good at this youtube thing. You’ve literally never heard that before. But, seriously, interesting results from this test. There are some dark horses we have identified based on their baseline talent level heading into the Euros, there are also some paper tigers that have more name-brand power than actual ability to win Euro 2020. Football Manager has to be considered the most accurate football or soccer simulator in the world, so it’s only fair it’s Euro 2020 predictions should be considered the holy grail. We just pushed it to an unreasonable extreme with the 100 honestly.

Much Love,
The Zealand

29,Zealand,xptBjKu5WkI,854.0,"Every time a new Football Manager comes out I field a ton of questions about whether it is worth it to buy the game. FM22 has been no different. Are there enough new features? Do you like the match engine? What is the new good tactic? I love FM so I am happy to help answer these, but I also had an idea. I think that Football Manager suffers from the same issue as other yearly sports games, but given its unique nature (intense spreadsheet staring and trying to replicate a coaching experience instead of a gameplay one) there is an opportunity.

I won’t give up the whole idea here. There is a video right above this description where I describe it in a much more articulate and hopefully entertaining way. But, I am serious, I think Football Manager has an opportunity to break the mold it has cast itself in. It also has a chance to save me from the endless questions about whether FM22 is worth buying and isn’t that enough of a humanitarian issue to consider action?

Much Love,

FM Llama from the Managers Seat has joined me once again to compile the most extensive list of fun saves you have ever seen. I hope this serves as a guide for years to keep your Football Manager experience exciting. It certainly might be a guide for me to pick my saves in FM in the future.

This list includes every country that is in the base game of Football Manager. There are other countries you can play in but you have to download a database that was made by a mod person. These can be cool too, but if we made that list instead, this video would be two hours long, so I hope you’re ok with every country in Football Manager!

Much Love,
FM Senpai

35,Zealand,WaklUnCR60M,786.0,"I respect what Football Manager do and the game they make, but there was a wave of miscommunication around dynamic youth rating and its implementation into FM22. It caused a wave of hope, then confusion as people tested FM for answers, then an explanation that means very little has actually changed. It is all covered in the video but I am left feeling very disappointed with a feature I was once tremendously excited about. That is just not a fun feeling to have.

I really do want a functional way to build a nation in the future. It is such a long-held dream of mine that I probably had it before I even knew what Football Manager was, I just knew that someday in an unnamed video game I would want to turn an obscure nation into a footballing powerhouse that could rival brazil and then I found FM and now we are here with that dream still unrealized. I have faith it will be eventually be rectified, as long as we keep putting the pressure on and asking for it.


Much Love,
FM Senpai

I'm heading to Italy and Serie A for the first time on YouTube! The league has been getting more competitive than ever and one club that until last season defied all expectations was Atalanta.

However after a spell of Champions League football last season they finished 8th place and missed out on Europe. With an ageing squad, and limited assets to sell on for funds, it might well be time for a rebuild. Retaining some of their tactical style can we take them to the top of Italian football and beyond?

41,Zealand,N9wQCaJf8H8,718.0,"The FIFA World Cup is my favorite sporting event. So when we realized on stream that watching Football Manager simulate future World Cup’s was fun? We had to do it. Then after we watched the 2022 World Cup, we had Reece edit it so people who couldn’t be there live could enjoy it! We generally do one major tournament simulation like the World Cup a month, so catch you on stream if you liked it.

I love Football Manager for the stories it is able to tell. This form of playing the game is honestly capable of producing some of the best stories and future simulations out of anything I’ve done (and it takes far less tutorial watching to succeed at). If you’ve read this far into the description thanks you get a prize, the next video is 10 FM tricks. *wink wink* you didn’t hear it from me. Unless this is like months later, then you might have already known. FIFA WORLD CUP TIME WOO.

Much love,
The Zealand. FM Senpai Esquire.

The installation tutorial ► https://youtu.be/pmdIkhfmY6w

The single most exciting FM project I’ve ever been a part of is this regen (technically newgen) facepack. We put out a program that changed the way many people play Football Manager. It wasn’t perfect though, so we sat down to make it even better for FM22. The face mapping and the functionality have been improved AND we came up with a way for you to update the app while keeping your old profiles.

I want you all to know we are still working on other major improvements to the newgan app. There are some advancements to the technology that if they came to FM would once again take the realism to an 11 out of 10. Just know that I will continue to do everything I can to make Football Manager as awesome as possible, but go enjoy the better faces on regens and newgens and I’ll see you on stream or Twitter or something soon.



Much Love,
FM Senpai

Well, we’ll get as close as we can to 1000 years until the game breaks, which turned out to be 830 years into the future! The top teams have shuffled all over the place and there are new heroes amongst the Premier League, Bundesliga, and Serie A. Or are there? 

I have to keep the mystery up somewhat. We look at the top five leagues, the champions league and the World Cup to bring all the crazy stories from the future to you thanks to FM’s incredible capability to just keep going. There’s something to be said for just continuing on and on and on and on and on and on to produce the insane stories that we saw develop over the course of this simulation. I hope you enjoy!

Much Love,

In the world of football, or soccer, there are nearly a billion fans. Probably more honestly, but fortunately not all of them have access to Twitter. For the ones that do, the fact that I grew up as an American saying the word soccer is apparently a fate worse than death. I made a video about the origins of the word soccer, which is used widely in every English-speaking country that is not the UK, but that message seems to have missed the work. So, why do I want the world to get comfortable with the word soccer?

Well, I make my living talking about the sport. I grew up calling it that. My country grew up calling football, soccer. Not to spite anyone, Americans call it soccer because another version of the rules claimed the name football then shifted to using the hands. The most important thing to remember here is: who cares. I just want to not be self-conscious when making a video and using the word soccer. Maybe not for me, but for my kids. That sounds overdramatic, but based on your reactions, it may actually take that long.

Much Love,
FM Senpai
