6,Zealand,e_HSqKXz2HY,535323,"Everyone that plays Football Manager eventually runs into this feeling: you are chugging along, youâ€™ve watched some FM tutorials, some tips and tricks, and your club is cooking FM like a Saturday barbecueâ€¦ only to start losing out of nowhere. There is seemingly nothing you can do on Football Manager to turn your form around and what you did previously doesnâ€™t work at all.

On FM this can happen after a new season starts, in can happen in the middle, it can happen at the end, and it will always ruin your day. What you have to do to fix this Football Manager challenge is first diagnose what is causing the poor run of form in the first place, because it is not always a poor bout of form necessarily. A few of the saves in this SYS give us a good chance to get you right.





Much Love,
FM Senpai

How do you get that high potential wonderkid to reach their potential? It is the number one question that dictates every Football Manager save I do. I talk so much about how to sign those amazing wonderkids in the first place, but for years I have not taken the DEEP dive into wonderkid development on Football Manager. It is a good thing we have our heroic training team to lead the way.

A lot of this stuff I had never even thought about before we started working on this FM training series. The idea of specifically tailored training sessions with your youth teams was completely foreign to me, but it all suddenly made sense. There are piles and piles of good training tips in this video along the way, plus ready-made training schedules for your wonderkids to get absolutely everything out of them and get you to the Champions League title faster than ever on Football Manager.

Much Love,
FM Senpai


BE SURE YOUR WONDERKIDS ARE IN THE RIGHT UNIT FOR YOUR SPECIFIC TRAINING. IT WOULD BE A SHAME IF THE AMAZING WINGBACK THAT YOU WANTED TO TRAIN OFFENSIVELY WAS IN THE DEFENSIVE UNIT FOR TRAINING.

8,Zealand,Psf-WyPNlSA,521730,"Football Manager is a challenging game with so many different layers, there is no way to make guides and tutorials about all of them. Each player on FM21 is going to run into an experience with their squad, scouting, tactics, or transfers that noone else has ever had. So, what is the best way to help everyone on FM if all this is true? How about I take your saves that have problems, and try to save them.

We have been doing this on stream for quite some time now, but we recently ran into a situation where I had too many saves to save before I left. Amazingly, there is only so much time I can spend playing Football Manager. Thusly, I have decided to use the word thusly, and impart any wisdom I can to guide people on FM21 to the promised land that they have not yet been able to find. No hard feelings about anything, everything in football manager can be something that undoes your save so there is something that all of us overlook. Onward!

Much Love,
FM Senpai

Well, probably a little less sassy, but hopefully just as helpful. Honestly, I think it was even more helpful considering we could have conversations about the tactics, wonderkids, and transfers that had gone on.

Previously, the only conversation that happened on save your saves was between me and a sheet of paper that some people wrote some things down on, but this was different. This was me seeing things on the sheet and then being able to ask about them, so I help this really helps your FM saves even more!

I have played Football Manager for a long time and I have played Football Manager for a lot of hours. I have never seen a wonderkid this good. I honestly thought it was impossible and in real life it almost is. A wonderkind so good on FM they could walk into a Premier League dressing room at 15 years old and make an impact on the field. That is before you even get to what this wonderkid could become in a few years.

This video isnâ€™t just for oogling though. I take you through how I found this player of all players and how you can find them too. Thereâ€™s also the small problem of keeping your FM wonderkids safe from PSG, Man United, and Real Madrid, so we talk about the strategies you need to keep your best young players in your squad and away from those pesky transfers. The key is signing them to a 20-year contract when theyâ€™re 15. That is not a thing in Football Manager but oh my goodness I wish it was.




Much Love,
FM Senpai

15,Zealand,CQVYA9PChR8,461106,"Saving your saves on FM is back! We do it on stream about once a month so since you all enjoyed it on YouTube too, I figured we could save your saves on Football Manager 2021 again. I picked four saves from the hammers that had different issues, one with tactics, one with morale, and some transfer, scouting, and team building questions. As you would expect, running the FM gamut. There is, of course, also the biggest TURN in form Iâ€™ve seen on FM. Not overall run, but the most abrupt switch from dominance to losing Football Manager has ever shown me.

This series has already turned into a lot of fun. Itâ€™s a pretty unique idea in FM and I appreciate the hammers helping me come up with it on stream. I hope if youâ€™ve made it this far youâ€™ll consider joining the stream itself. We are usually playing FM, after all. So it wonâ€™t be a huge jump for you. The live sports saves and the save your saves stuff is all there too. Itâ€™s literally the same thing. Just able to talk about tactics for longer, basically the only difference. And the dancing, but we donâ€™t talk about that.

Much Love,
FM Senpai

I once made an entire playlist about how to play Football Manager but now I will try to make the same tutorial in 10 minutes. A short video that is all you need to watch in order to start playing and enjoying FM. I suppose this guide in particular is the sum total of my work on this channel, the reason I started making YouTube videos, to make Football Manager accessible.

This is for people that have never played Football Manager before, if you have which is probably a lot of you, then hopefully it helps orient you. May I recommend all the other guides on this channel to help further your knowledge once you finish this. This video is a gateway drug to the full Zealand experience, or something.

Well, weâ€™ll get as close as we can to 1000 years until the game breaks, which turned out to be 830 years into the future! The top teams have shuffled all over the place and there are new heroes amongst the Premier League, Bundesliga, and Serie A. Or are there? 

I have to keep the mystery up somewhat. We look at the top five leagues, the champions league and the World Cup to bring all the crazy stories from the future to you thanks to FMâ€™s incredible capability to just keep going. Thereâ€™s something to be said for just continuing on and on and on and on and on and on to produce the insane stories that we saw develop over the course of this simulation. I hope you enjoy!

So now, it is time to assemble the worse teams in the world to play their own World Cup. It is only fair. They might not have Messi but these teams do try to qualify every time and never seem to have a chance to make the World Cup. Fear no more!


We put together a qualifying system that only gets the worst of the worst with a good balance between all of the continents. It felt like the best way to do it, make sure itâ€™s fair for everyone. Asia still got a crazy number of teams in though, which was fun for them, but not really for some of the other continents, because their World Cup teams got abused. It was a very fun journey, I hope you enjoy it!

Much Love,

24,Zealand,_FHDMRWWKXk,429328,"I have had the chance to diagnose a lot of different problems over the year weâ€™ve been saving saves. There are always complex finances, scouting conundrums, and a wide variety of random awfulness that Football Manager can throw at you from time to time. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever been able to blame a tactic on FM for as much as I am able to in this save your saves video. I know tactics are difficult to get right, but I suppose sometimes you follow your heart and itâ€™s just wrong.

What is very interesting is that in the same save with the struggling tactic, the scouting for wonderkids has gone incredibly well. It was done with great skill in a way that sets an example for other people looking to build a team in a similar way. That is, the best way because signing a bucket of wonderkids and developing a golden core of players is just the best way to go about business in Football Manager - 30-year-olds be damned. Enjoy the latest edition of SYS!

25,Zealand,_Z97UdP9_0k,426650,"There are a lot of debates on the use of playmakers. Can you have two in FM without blowing up your tactic entirely? Is it possible to win without a playmaker in your team with consistency? What does Football Manager rate playmakerâ€™s match ratings harsher than the Miss Universe competition? Well, these are all fair questions, what is very hard to argue for is the idea that you need THREE playmakers in your squad.

It is just so hard to balance a tactic, to begin with because if you account for everything youâ€™re putting on no pressure, but if you put on the pressure youâ€™re not accounting for something. If you have three people occupied in one job (thereâ€™s only one ball) itâ€™s that much harder to get a sound Football Manager tactic set up. I talk about it more in the video, but itâ€™s definitely something a lot of people can accidentally wander into. Thereâ€™s also plenty of other tactic tips, scouting, player transfers, and such. The classic LOANS and wonderkids galore, all the good stuff.

Much Love,
FM Senpai

This includes a very special one too.

That doesnâ€™t sit right with me because my goodness this is a wonderful game and I want to make sure everyone can enjoy it. I say happy FMing for a reason! I think!

30,Zealand,zK4kehpBKdA,419347,"The decision on which role to play in Football Manager is always a difficult one. Except when it isnâ€™t. Sometimes, a tactic or a playerâ€™s attributes make it so obvious what role a player should be playing that it requires a really significant amount of oversight to not get it right. I suppose that is what we are here to correct, but please, PLEASE, when you are putting together a tactic make sure you have players with attributes that can actually pull off what you are asking them to do. I love you all, enjoy the game, but be sure.

I do love breaking out the save your saves again. We get a lot of submissions now, even though weâ€™ve limited it to twitch subscribers, so we try to pick a wide range of saves to cover as much FM ground as possible when giving out tips and tricks. I know some of you want me to pick the people completely failing at FM, and we do a few of those, but I also want to guide people in other phases of the game as well. Itâ€™s all about getting everyone to the champions league title and the hurdle is in a different place for everyone.

It is finally here. I teased it on Twitter and the response was overwhelming. I honestly thought I was nerding out too much, but I mustâ€™ve forgotten who was playing Football Manager in the first place. All love, of course, Iâ€™m right there with you, I am absolutely pumped for this. I hope it revolutionizes scouting in Football Manager for years to come. At least it will make scouting in FM cooler than before. 

I love when we are able to do stuff like this. Sometimes a simple email turns into a video that will change the way people play the game. I did not anticipate that. Then Ayal just went off putting together the spreadsheet and all I did was provide the framework and pretty face to top it off. I should be talking more about what this is but I am too excited. Enjoy an actual spreadsheet with your next wonderkid on it. 

Much Love,
FM Senpai

32,Zealand,SXIe9gAoq2s,413179,"There are a lot of ways to win on Football Manager but some of the tactics we just looked at seem impossible, like thereâ€™s no way they actually workâ€¦ but I kind of want to try it. The FM community has conjured up some inspiration as I take Tom and Clayts through a list of tactics that might just change the way you play the game forever. I rate this video 10/10.

34,Zealand,pmdIkhfmY6w,406866,"So, you want the best regen / newgen facepack ever made? Well, here you go! In an effort that took nearly a year, we managed to create a complete pack of ethnically sorted, AI-generated faces (which are unlimited in sample size and thus can be created to no end) that then assign to your regens or newgens while recognizing skin color and ethnicity. I canâ€™t imagine someone has put more effort into a Football Manager facepack for newgens and regens than this. Iâ€™m happy to finally, actually tell you how to use it.

The first video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZRcjkRKbLE&t=268s) I didnâ€™t do a great job of actually teaching you how to use it, and v1 was super buggy compared to now, so it was time to iron out the bugs and the installation process. Now FM has the perfect facepack on windows and mac, in a few easy steps. If only football manager had managed to keep my mac charger from dying while filming, then the NewGAN guide would be with you a few days earlier. I touched my mac for you, just to show how much I care.

Happy installing - if you have any questions, hit the comments! I promise weâ€™ve really sorted every bug now thanks to yaâ€™lls help it should be 100% smooth for every setup.

41,Zealand,Ov3WqsdxxJI,397155,"YO WATTUP ITâ€™S ZEALAND BACK WITH ANOTHER SAVE YOUR SAVES YO. I figured I needed to use a nice, old-school YouTuber intro for once. It felt right. This month we got hit with a bunch of different people struggling financially in Football Manager, they had taken on massive debt to get to the level they reached, but how do you get comfortable and not have a meltdown? A lot of things, I should probably make more guides on money in FM. 

This will have to do instead. Winning certainly helps though, and usually not winning and financial struggles go hand-in-hand. This means this Save Your Saves is all about the same stuff as the past ones too, it is full of tactics guides, scouting guides, training guides, transfer guides, wonderkid guides, all the good stuff. That is a lot of guides. I think at least one of them is a tutorial, but who can be sure.

Much Love,
FM Senpai

Hey - happy holidays, I hope you got Football Manager! Whether you did or you already had FM, FM Llama and I have sat down to put together a truly wonderful guide that should keep you entertained for ages. A list of one great save in every European league in Football Manager. We thought about doing the whole world, but that is just a bit excessive isnâ€™t it, while one save for every FM European league is totally reasonable and definitely didnâ€™t take any time at all.

FM Llama and I had a great time compiling this list - he is a genius - and I know this will be supplying saves for everyone long into the future. That makes me happy, because there is nothing more frustrating in Football Manager than knowing you want to play it but not having the faintest idea about how to get into a save, or what save you want to do. Now all you have to do is watch all the other tutorials about how to play FM in the first place and you will be all set!

Much Love,
FM Senpai & The Llama

44,Zealand,dpMMdNFHvtU,394218,"I try to find themes for these videos, but this time the theme found me. Everyone is at that point in their Football Manager save where they feel stuck and donâ€™t know how to move forward. This can be to push into the Premier League, take a league title, or take the Champions League at long last. Sometimes it can feel like FM has locked you into place, so let me try to provide the key.

This is usually learning how to spend money the right way. I think another issue that plagues people who play Football Manager is not knowing what it actually takes to accomplish something. If you are trying to rise through the ranks, not every player that has played well in the past will be able to join you. Identifying the wonderkids that can hang amongst the players you have to thank for their service is a very valuable ability. 

Much Love,
FM Senpai

48,Zealand,dypqlQ6F75c,382533,"Wonderkids are the magic ingredient in Football Manager, but how does one capitalize on them in FM20? I break down the different types of talented young players and how to develop them into stars. Personality, mentoring, scouting, star ratings, training, loans - they all have a role to play, and thatâ€™s before the wunderkind ever touches the field.

As I do, I broke it into sections or â€˜typesâ€™ of talented youngsters. There are model citizens, surprises, illusions, and everything in between. I promise itâ€™s about to make more sense. The timing of loans and the importance of playing time are perhaps the most key instrument of all of these categories though, so keep your ears peeled for that.


Much love,

Will Still has taken the Football world by storm, after he took the Football Manager world by storm. The 30-year-old is five years younger than Messi and has exploded into the profession by leading a Ligue 1 side in Stade de Reims from the depths of the table to 13 unbeaten matches and counting. This is including a draw away to PSG.

He was born in 1992 and itâ€™s the third team he has coached, itâ€™s a wild story and the video tells it, so I donâ€™t really know exactly what youâ€™re doing down here, unless youâ€™re looking for one of the links below. There are a lot of them, I try to take care of you when I can. The lives are particularly fun if you get a chance.
